# Thoughts (Legacy)

`Thoughts` is the legacy name for what is now called **Memory**.

Use the Memory page instead:

- [Memory](./Memory)

Compatibility is still preserved in code:

- `shortTermMemory` -> legacy alias of `memory`
- `inspect().thoughts` -> legacy alias of `inspect().memory`
- `replayThoughts(...)` -> legacy alias of `replayMemory(...)`
