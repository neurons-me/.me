# Shared Meaning

`.me` does not treat language as a fixed dictionary.  
It treats language as structure plus relation.

In this model:

- words are labels,
- operators are logic,
- pointers are semantic links,
- and meaning emerges from shared graph shape.

## Semantic Fingerprint

Meaning in `.me` is behavior + structure, not raw string similarity.

| Component | Role in Shared Meaning | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| Labels | Local surface/interface | The skin of the fruit |
| Operators | Rules of state change | The physics of the system |
| Pointers | Explicit resolution links | Bridges between regions |
| Structure | Core semantic pattern | DNA / skeleton |

Two graphs can use different labels and still be equivalent if their derivations, dependencies, and operator behavior align.

## Key Insights

1. ##### Logic as the common layer
- Natural languages diverge, but many domain relations (tax math, inventory flows, family trees) are structurally stable.
- In `.me`, convergence happens when dependency graphs and derivation logic are equivalent.

2. ##### No single global schema
- Traditional systems force naming consensus first.
- `.me` allows local schemas and aligns meaning through structural relations plus pointers.

3. ##### Dynamic convergence through pointers
- `->` does not claim ontological identity by itself.
- It creates functional aliasing in resolution paths, and network-level meaning strengthens as structural links accumulate.

## Structure Before Vocabulary

If two communities build the same structural graph with different labels, `.me` can treat them as the same semantic pattern.

Example:

```ts
// Spanish-shaped graph
me.tienda.articulos[1].precio(100);
me.tienda.impuesto(0.16);
me.tienda.articulos[1]["="]("total", "precio + (precio * tienda.impuesto)");

// Japanese-shaped graph
me.店舗.商品[1].価格(100);
me.店舗.税率(0.16);
me.店舗.商品[1]["="]("合計", "価格 + (価格 * 店舗.税率)");
```

Both graphs compute the same relation:

- base value
- shared rate
- derived total

Different labels, same semantic geometry.

## Pointers as Semantic Synapses

A pointer in `.me` is not only a technical redirect.  
It can also act as a community-created semantic bridge.

```ts
me.perro["->"]("dog");
me.dog["->"]("inu");
```

This is more than translation text.  
It encodes: these symbols should collapse to one shared reference path during resolution.

That means communities can build living bridges:

- no global authority required,
- no single static dictionary required,
- links evolve with usage.

## From Local Trees to Collective Meaning

Every `.me` runtime starts local.  
But when paths, operators, and pointers are shared, local trees can converge into a distributed semantic fabric.

You can think of it as:

- **Path labels**: the visible surface (language, culture, domain jargon)
- **Operators**: the computational grammar
- **Pointers**: cross-community wiring
- **Derivations**: reproducible logic

Over time, recurring structures form clusters of shared meaning.

## Why This Matters for `cleaker.me`

`cleaker.me` can be the coordination layer where these clusters meet:

- not as a centralized “truth editor,”
- but as a shared coordinate space for semantic references.

Possible shape:

- canonical concept coordinate (structural core),
- multiple language/domain views as aliases,
- pointers maintaining alignment.

So `perro.cleaker.me`, `dog.cleaker.me`, and `犬.cleaker.me` can be views over the same semantic locus.

## Realistic Use Cases

#### Cross-language commerce

- One region models `tienda.articulos.precio`
- Another models `shop.items.price`
- Shared derivation logic and pointers align analytics/automation without forcing one vocabulary.

#### Clinical terminology bridging

- Hospitals use different naming conventions.
- Shared derivation + pointers map local terms to common clinical concepts.

#### Multilingual AI memory

- User writes memories in mixed languages.
- Runtime links recurring patterns structurally, not by brittle literal translation.

## Design Principle

`.me` does not ask:

"What is the one official word?"

It asks:

"What are the stable relations, and how are communities linking them?"

That is why shared meaning in `.me` is:

- decentralized,
- composable,
- and operational (it runs as logic, not only as metadata).
