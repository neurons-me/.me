this.me conceptualizes a fundamental, binary-based "ontological operating system" where reality is constructed from basic, non-hierarchical distinctions (occupied/empty) rather than fixed physical laws [1]. By treating identity as an operator of distinction within an "information-as-computation" framework, the project explores how complex geometry emerges from repeated logical bifurcations [1]. More information about this approach to information structure can be found on the npm package page.
